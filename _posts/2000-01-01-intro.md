I’m an archaeologist studying past landscapes and social memory. Landscape can be many things: a configuration of rural or urban sites, ancient field systems, local vegetation cover and geology, ritual places and monuments – and then all these things together. In my work, landscape stands for an approach that puts space before place. More precisely, I study how ancient populations got to know their space, what they made of it, and how such space made them think about themselves.   

Unwisely, I maintain several web sites:
- [LandscapeArchaeology.org](https://landscapearchaeology.org), which deals with spatial (GIS) analysis and archaeology
- [Fragments de mémoire](https://fragments.hypotheses.org), where I occasionaly post on social memory and epistemology (with regrads to archaeology)
- [Aux quatre vents](https://zoran.hcommons.org) on Humanities Commons which should (one day) replace my presence on commercial platforms, namely Academia.edu
